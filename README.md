# Node.js Express REST API Demo and Starter
Welcome to the Node.js REST API demo repository! This repository demonstrates how to build a starter RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and Jest for testing. The code structure adheres to industry-standard project organization practices, focusing on separating concerns, romoting modularity and code reusability.

You may use the repository to learn about these technologies. Also, you may use it as an starter for more complex RESTful APIs, as it already has the standar project and folder structure, an example endpoint to get you started and its corresponding test in Jest.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out with any questions or feedback!
